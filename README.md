# TinyVM

This tinyVM is an implementation of [GenTiradentes' TinyVM][tvm] in Python (the original is written in C).

This is my first attempt at a VM, so huge thanks to GenTiradentes for making a minimal one, easy to grasp. Also, [Specter][specter](the Go version) inspired me much, thanks to its author.
